In Contrast, much of the federal culture in Ottawa and the older provinces, emerges from an entrenched professional managerial class and bureaucratic worldview that feels distant and often dismissive of Western values and realities.  The federal government has grown in both size and ideological distance.  Ubder Liberal leadership, the federal bureaucracy has embraced policies and narrative that feel foreign to me.  Compelled speech laws like BillC-16 undermine the principle of free expression, somehting many view as a core Canadian value.  Moreover, recent political rhetoric has suggested that there is no clear Canadian identity, a view used to justify mass immigration policies that dilute the distinct cultural heritage of the original settler populations, often with immigration from cultures with incompatible values.  The overton window has shited so far left that the Liberal party, once a champion of classic liberalism, now promotes policies that reflect collectivist, even socialist or authoritarian ideologies.

I can only be defined based on the people I've met, and the ones I've related to the most have always belonged to this land, long before it was stolen from them, before their children and grandchildren were subject to the genocide of Indian Residential Schools.

Stopped relying on media to explain policy & explained to the people via an app to show them what tax dollars are going towards, what policies are being implemented that we voted for, & why actions are being taken (to prevent misinformation). Started to address the christian & white supremacy in our systems, ended funding for religious schools  hospitals, & any other public institutions should be nondenominational. Created an education campaign against supremacy, hate & intolerance, & stopped allowing it in parliament. Made other religious holidays national holidays with paid leave, not just christian ones.

The Country is incredibly poorly managed and we may lose our Soveriegnty because of their ineptitude on a multitude of issues. Its embarrassing actually. 
So, while I still have National Pride it feels like its fading to helplessness watching the Nation erode to National Shame and disgust. This bugs me on a daily basis.

Half their time would be on projects, the other half on National defence. 
Then I would want to see a National population redistribution scheme. 
A formula for filling in the blanks across the map. 
Then I’d like to see quotas on immigration based on a more balanced countries of origin mosaic. We should have American quotas which are higher  as well as more Europeans. 
We need better Arctic defence. We need more Nato involvement. 
The Country’s infrastructure is eroding. We need to shift to better public transportation in Medium and smaller cities with less emphasis on road construction. Most municipalities cannot afford to maintain the roads they have let alone new ones. 
A moratorium on urban sprawl in major Cities with a focus on Core redevelopment is how to achieve it. Creative tax structures need to be a part of driving that. 

There’s so much that needs to be done. 
Transformational change and it will cost a bundle. 
The Gov’t needs to mortgage to investment over a 100 year timeline imo. 
If this happens, I’ll be very excited about Canada but I truly believe politicians will screw it up then dangle carrots of more free stuff to get re-elected without making any progress.

Then  Trudeau declared there was no national Canadian identity. Fraser Institute released a study showing that Canadian pride had dipped 80% which is nuts. Then Trump went crazy and all of a sudden we were all proud to be Canadian again. But we can't define ourselves by resistance to a common enemy or the fact that we're not American. We have a religious history that our justice system is based on, but that has been erased as we're so afraid to give credit to Christian successes. We're taught about the atrocities done to the aboriginal people (and rightly so, that should have never happened), but the parts of our history where European settlers and their descendants succeeded in creating a functioning country that stands for justice (sometimes that took a while unfortunately) is left out. We need to get back to our roots, whether they be aboriginal, European, or otherwise and ACCEPT what happened and move forward together. That would be the real bragging point for Canadians, not that we're not Trump/American. I'm so tired of it.
